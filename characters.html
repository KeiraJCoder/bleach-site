<h1>Honourable Mentions</h1>
<br>
<h2>Captains</h2>

<p>The Bleach Captains are all members of the Gotei 13. Their duty is to provide protection to the Soul Society and the Human World from threats such as the Hollows. This prestigious position requires a lot of courage, strength and leadership skills, leading to just a handful of Shinigami who are qualified for this position. The role of a Bleach Captain isn’t without mortal dangers either, many of them have given their life up for their duty. </p>

<h1>Bleach Enemies</h1>

<p>Arrancar are a group of Hollows that gained similar powers to that of a Shinigami by removing their masks. The individuals that Aizen turned into Arrancar using the Hōgyoku, generally possess powers far beyond those of previous Arrancar. Especially powerful Arrancar were assigned ten numbers by Sōsuke Aizen and came to be known as the Espada.</p><br><br>

<p>The Visored are the antithesis to the Arrancar as Shinigami who have obtained Hollow powers.

    Having begun as Shinigami, the Visored appear entirely Human and, barring when they are using their powers, are indistinguishable from ordinary Shinigami. To gain access to their Hollow powers, a Visored dons a Hollow mask. This allows them to augment their Shinigami abilities with Hollow powers, as well as giving them access to some of the more generic Hollow abilities</p><br><br>

<p>Hollows (虚 (ホロウ), Horō) are a race of creatures which are born from Human souls who, for various reasons, do not cross over to Soul Society after their death and stay in the Human World for too long. They are corrupt spirits with supernatural powers which devour the souls of both living and deceased Humans. </p><br><br>

<ol> 
    <li>   There are total 3 stages of hollow evolution</li>
    
    <li>   1st - The Menos Grande</li>
    <li>  2nd - Adjuchas</li>
    <li>   3rd - Vasto Lorde</li>
</ol>




<p> Menos are created when the void within an ordinary Hollow's heart becomes so substantial Human souls are incapable of sustaining it, at which point it begins devouring fellow Hollows. ... Menos-class Hollows are considered so dangerous Soul Society sends only highly trained Shinigami teams to handle them.</p><br><br>
